Welcome to QuiXtudy! (Pronounced 'quick study')

This app has been deployed to https://quixtudy.herokuapp.com and is available for use now!

This application was created by the request of a medical student at VCOMM (shoutout to Ashley) out of need for a quicker way to make flashcards for studying. Other flashcard applications out there only allow users to create flashcards one at a time, which can be very time consuming. This application ultimately helps you save that precious time to spend on actually studying the material, not prepping it.

With QuiXtudy, you can:
1. Quickly create and add multiple flashcards - as many as needed - to a collection using a single input.
2. Share an entire collection of flashcards with other users of the app through a simple click-and-search.
3. Edit or remove any of your collections and/or flashcards after they've been created or even shared with you.
4. Of course, test yourself on the flashcards you created and keep track of how many you got right or wrong.

Hope you enjoy!

This project was set up using the steps in the README of this repository: https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/react-rails-project-setup-guide.
